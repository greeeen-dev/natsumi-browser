## Meet Natsumi! ü¶ã
Natsumi Browser (or Natsumi, for short) is a skin made for Firefox and its forks that adds lots of
polish to the design by incorporating animations, blurs and more. It's pretty much the skin I
personally use, but made public because people wanted the CSS.

Natsumi is NOT a standalone browser. I don't even intend on making one.

> [!NOTE]
> Please remember that Natsumi in the end is **my personal browser skin**. If you don't like a design
> choice I've made, chances are I'll keep it if I still like it. So please be respectful and refrain
> from attacking people when you make suggestions. Thanks!

## Features
### ‚ú® Your browser, reimagined.

hand when you don't need the extra tools.

### üñºÔ∏è Express yourself with themes.
#### A theming engine that lets your browser vibe with you.

  A light gradient of the accent color, similar to my Zen Browser gradient.

| Floorp      | :white_check_mark: Supported  | 12+      | Not supported on Floorp 11 as it uses an incompatible version of Firefox.      |
| Waterfox    | :white_check_mark: Supported  | 6.6.0+   | Not supported on Waterfox 6.5.0 as it uses an incompatible version of Firefox. |
| Librewolf   | :warning: Partially supported | 137+     | Supported, but animations may be laggy due to no hardware acceleration.        |
| Midori      | :x: Unsupported               | -        | Not supported as it uses an incompatible version of Firefox.                   |
| Mullvad/Tor | :x: Unsupported               | 15.0+    | Marked as unsupported as Tor/Mullvad version 15 is in alpha.                   |

## FAQs
### "Can I use other userchromes with Natsumi?"
Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader (userChrome.css) and you can use your own
userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser.

### "Can I disable individual features?"
You can disable some features using the configuration options.

If that doesn't help, you can remove certain modules (CSS files) from the natsumi.css file. However,
you will need to keep certain files (preload, postload, natsumi-config) for Natsumi to work properly.

> [!CAUTION]
> By modifying any part of Natsumi, you are responsible for any issues that may arise. If things do
> break, I will most likely not offer support for it.
>
> If you installed Natsumi as part of another skin, your installation may be considered modified.
> Please check with the skin's developer for assistance in this case.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with Zen Browser?"
As of Natsumi v4, Natsumi has dropped all support for Zen Browser. I have no plans to continue
support whatsoever due to the browser's main developer's stance on personalization, as well as
various other reasons.

Additionally, it'd be a hassle to make things compatible with Zen, mainly because it is just so
heavily modified from the original Firefox that I may end up building a whole new skin just for
compatibility unintentionally.

### "When does Natsumi update?"
There is no fixed schedule for updates, it all happens randomly.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with non-Firefox-based browsers (Chrome, Arc, etc.)?"
No. Natsumi is made on top of Firefox, so it only supports Firefox and (most of) its forks.

If you try to apply Natsumi on Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply
userchrome CSS files, making Natsumi completely incompatible with those browsers.

### "I don't like the design, please change it!"
If I like the design, nah. My personal skin, my rules.

### "Why is userChrome.css so empty?"
Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin,
instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable
and disable custom CSS.

### "mrrp"
meow :3

## Troubleshooting
### "URLbar blur won't work!"
Make sure both `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.force-enabled` are
set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering.

### "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!"
These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on
the right to create the config.

### "I don't see the Customize Natsumi option in the settings page!"
Please check that you've installed fx-autoconfig and `userChromeJS.persistent_domcontent_callback` is
true.

### "Something's bugged!"
There may be userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things. Please disable
these then try again.

If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.

### "Can I use your code for my browser?"
If your browser is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3 or later (or AGPLv3 or later), then yes.
Otherwise, please contact me so I can grant you permission.
