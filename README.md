## Meet Natsumi! ðŸ¦‹
Natsumi Browser (or Natsumi, for short) is a skin made for [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app)
that adds lots of polish to the design by incorporating animations, blurs and more. It's pretty much
the skin I personally use, but made public because people wanted the CSS.

Natsumi is NOT a standalone browser. I don't even intend on making one.

Natsumi has been tested on `1.11b` (Beta) and `1.11t 2025-04-03` (Twilight).

> [!NOTE]
> Please remember that Natsumi in the end is **my personal browser skin**. If you don't like a design
> choice I've made, chances are I'll keep it if I still like it. So please be respectful and refrain
> from attacking people when you make suggestions. Thanks!

## Features
### Polished look
Natsumi Browser sports a modern look to bring you a beautiful and polished browsing experience, while
keeping much of Zen Browser's original design.

### Natsumi URLbar
With Natsumi URLbar, Natsumi gives the expanded URLbar a completely fresh new look, so it feels very
cozy while also having lots of room for search suggestions. You can even make the URLbar stay out of
your way when collapsed with compact URLbar.

### Natsumi Findbar
Say hello to Natsumi Findbar! Natsumi Findbar shares a similar design as Natsumi URLbar, bringing you
the same cozy and modern experience. Inspired by [RobotoSkunk](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk)'s [Better
Find Bar](https://zen-browser.app/mods/a6335949-4465-4b71-926c-4a52d34bc9c0/) Mod.

### Natsumi PDF Viewer
Send your PDF viewer to the 21st century! Natsumi Browser Pages includes tweaks for the default PDF
viewer, giving it the modern look it really deserves. And with compact view, you can focus on the file
at hand when you don't need the extra tools.

### Enhanced sidebars
Elevate your sidebars to the next level! Not only does Natsumi add materials to both sidebars, it also
makes the Firefox sidebar more customizable by adding customization for its size and position.

Add even more screen real estate to compact mode by removing the website view's margins entirely. See
more of your website with even less distractions.

## FAQs
### "Can I use other userchromes with Natsumi?"
Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader (userChrome.css) and you can use your own
userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser.

### "Can I disable individual features?"
You can disable some features using the configuration options.

If that doesn't help, you can remove certain modules (CSS files) from the natsumi.css file. However,
you will need to keep certain files (preload, postload, natsumi-config) for Natsumi to work properly.

> [!CAUTION]
> By modifying any part of Natsumi, you are responsible for any issues that may arise. If things do
> break, I will most likely not offer support for it.
> 
> If you installed Natsumi as part of another skin, your installation may be considered modified.
> Please check with the skin's developer for assistance in this case.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with the newest version of Zen Browser?"
Natsumi is always developed and tested on the newest Zen Twilight, so that it's always compatible with
the newest Zen Browser right on release day.

If you are unsure if Natsumi is compatible with your version, check the tested versions in the beginning
of the README.

### "When does Natsumi update?"
There is no fixed schedule for updates.

Usually, I time my releases to happen when Zen Browser updates, so that Natsumi is always compatible
with the newest version of Natsumi right on update day.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with other browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Arc, etc.)?"
No. Natsumi is made on top of Zen Browser, so it only supports Zen Browser.

If you try to apply Natsumi on other Firefox or other Firefox-based browsers, things will definitely
break. As for Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply userchrome CSS files, making
Natsumi completely incompatible with those browsers.

I do have some plans to make a Firefox version called Natsumini, but I don't know if I'll go forward
with it.

### "I don't like the design, please change it!"
If I like the design, nah. My personal skin, my rules.

### "Can I use Natsumi with other Zen Mods?"
You can, but some mods (such as Better Find Bar and Super Url Bar) may conflict with Natsumi's CSS
rules. If this happens, please disable the conflicting mods or Natsumi features.

### "Why is userChrome.css so empty?"
Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin,
instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable
and disable custom CSS.

## Troubleshooting
### "URLbar blur won't work!"
Make sure both `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.force-enabled` are
set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering.

### "Zen Browser lags a lot!"
This may be due to the URLbar blurring or animations (likely the blur). Set `natsumi.theme.disable-blur`
to false to disable the blur, and `natsumi.urlbar.light` to true to disable the animations.

### "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!"
These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on
the right to create the config.

### "Something's bugged!"
There may be Zen Mods or userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things.
Please disable these then try again.

If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.
