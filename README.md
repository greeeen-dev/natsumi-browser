## Meet Natsumi! 🦋
Natsumi Browser (or Natsumi, for short) is a skin made for Firefox and its forks that adds lots of
polish to the design and adds new features to further enhance the browsing experience, while retaining
customization options to allow you to fully make things yours.

Natsumi is NOT a standalone browser. It only supports Firefox-based browsers that are not known to
be hostile towards user personalization.

> [!NOTE]
> Please remember that Natsumi in the end is **my personal browser skin**. If you don't like a design
> choice I've made, chances are I'll keep it if I still like it. So please be respectful and refrain
> from attacking people when you make suggestions. Thanks!

## Features
### ✨ Your browser, reimagined.
#### The classic Firefox design but with a modern spin.
![](./images/main.png)

Natsumi keeps your browser's design familiar while adding a modern touch to it.

### ⌨️ URL bar, made intuitive.
#### Highlights the current URL and adapts to the scene.
![](./images/urlbar.png)

Natsumi URLbar is a new take on your browser's address bar, which highlights the current URL and
changes appearance based on the context.

### 🖥️ Reimagined Picture-in-picture.
#### Modern and streamlined.

![](./images/pip-movement.png)

Natsumi's Picture-in-picture adds a more modern look to Firefox's PiP to make it more consistent with
the rest of the browser. You can even scroll to reposition the PiP window, too!

### 🎛️ Meet your Miniplayer.
#### Keep your media in control with the Miniplayer.
![](./images/miniplayer.png)

Natsumi lets you control your media through the Miniplayer located on the sidebar. And with support
for multiple websites at a time, you don't have to make your tabs fight for a spot on the Miniplayer.

### 📄 PDF viewer, modernized.
#### View your documents in the 21st century.

![](./images/pdf-viewer.png)

Give Firefox's PDF viewer a fresh coat of paint! Natsumi includes tweaks for the default PDF viewer,
giving it the modern look it really deserves. And with compact view, you can focus on the file at
hand when you don't need the extra tools.

### 🔧 Customization made easier.
#### Customize Natsumi in the preferences page without touching advanced configs.
![](./images/customization.png)

Natsumi adds its own Customize Natsumi pane to the preferences page, so you can easily customize
your installation of Natsumi graphically. No more figuring out which config does what.

### 🖼️ Express yourself with themes.
#### A theming engine that lets your browser vibe with you.
![](./images/custom-themes.png)

Let your browser be yours! Choose from nine theme varieties to get the look that resonates with you.

Or, take full control of Natsumi's theming engine and create your very own gradient, all without
being forced to stick to a specific color palette.

### 🎨 Color it all your way.
#### Also with Firefox themes support!
![](./images/custom-colors.png)

Don't like the default colors? Install a Firefox theme and Natsumi will adjust its colors for you.

Or, choose from one of the preset colors.

- $${\color{#a0d490}■}$$ **Light green** (default) - #a0d490

  macOS and Linux)!

### 🧘 Introducing Single Toolbar.
#### Move everything to the sidebar for a cleaner look.
![](./images/single-toolbar.png)

Craving the Single Toolbar look you can get in a certain other browser? Natsumi adds it to your
browser of choice.

### ⌨️ Customize your shortcuts.
#### Featuring keyboard shortcut conflict controls.
![](./images/shortcuts.png)

Take full control of your browser's keyboard shortcuts! Natsumi lets you customize your shortcuts
to your likings and even lets you choose how it should handle shortcut conflicts between the browser
and websites. No more being forced to show mercy to websites when shortcuts conflict.

### 🍰 Additional browser-specific goodies.
#### Get extra features custom-made for specific browsers.
![](./images/floorp-features.png)

Does your browser have Workspaces? Or another toolbar that can be used in the sidebar? Natsumi Append
adds extra features to your browser for a more complete experience.

## Full-fledged vs. CSS-only
Some Natsumi features require JavaScript to work. You can still use Natsumi without JS support at the
cost of losing some features.

## Installation
You will need to install Natsumi by copying its files to your profile's chrome folder.

### Automatic install
#### Installing via installer (macOS/Linux only)
Every release of Natsumi from v5 comes with an installer binary. You can run it to install Natsumi
Browser, Natsumi Browser Pages and Natsumi Append to your browser and profile of choice.

> [!CAUTION]
> Installing via Sine is possible but not supported. Icons and Natsumi Append WILL NOT work.

> [!NOTE]
> For macOS users, you will need to override the unsigned binary warning (also known as the "Apple could
> not verify "App" is free of malware" warning) by going to System Preferences => Security & Privacy
> after trying to run the installer.

### Manual install
Remember to take backups of your userChrome.css and userContent.css files before proceeding!

#### Installing Natsumi Browser and Natsumi Browser Pages
1. Copy natsumi-config.css, userChrome.css, userContent.css and natsumi folder to your chrome folder.
2. That's it - Natsumi (CSS-only) is installed!

#### Installing Natsumi Append (optional)
Installing Natsumi Append allows you to use the full feature set of Natsumi Browser, but it's not
required for the core parts of Natsumi to work.

Natsumi Browser needs to be installed before you can install Natsumi Append.

1. Install [fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig) to your browser. You need to
   install the contents of both program and profile/chrome, follow the instructions in the fx-autoconfig
   repository.
2. Copy the following to chrome/utils/chrome.manifest:
   ```
   content userchromejs ./
   content userscripts ../natsumi/scripts/
   skin userstyles classic/1.0 ../CSS/
   content userchrome ../resources/
   content natsumi ../natsumi/
   content natsumi-icons ../natsumi/icons/
   ```
3. Create and enable `userChromeJS.persistent_domcontent_callback` before restarting (don't worry, you
   can do this later. This config is needed for the preferences page to work.)
4. Go to about:support and clear your startup cache and restart your browser.
5. That's it - Natsumi Append is installed!

#### Advanced setup: If you are a techie who wants to keep your files up-to-date with new changes over time
After following either of the above steps, if you are interested in ensuring that you upgrade to the
latest version of Natsumi as new changes are released, you can simply clone the repository into the `chrome`
folder. This can be followed up with `git pull` from time-to-time.

## Browser configs (in about:config)
These are the configs you can use to tweak Natsumi Browser. If you want to tweak the animation duration
and delay, change the variables in the config.css file.

If you have Natsumi Append installed, most of these can be tweaked through the preferences page.

## FAQs
### "Can I use other userchromes with Natsumi?"
Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader (userChrome.css) and you can use your own
userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser.

### "Can I disable individual features?"
You can disable some features using the configuration options.

If that doesn't help, you can remove certain modules (CSS files) from the natsumi.css file. However,
you will need to keep certain files (preload, postload, natsumi-config) for Natsumi to work properly.

> [!CAUTION]
> By modifying any part of Natsumi, you are responsible for any issues that may arise. If things do
> break, I will most likely not offer support for it.
> 
> If you installed Natsumi as part of another skin, your installation may be considered modified.
> Please check with the skin's developer for assistance in this case.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with Zen Browser?"
As of Natsumi v4, Natsumi has dropped all support for Zen Browser. I have no plans to continue
support whatsoever due to the browser's main developer's stance on personalization, as well as
various other reasons.

Additionally, it'd be a hassle to make things compatible with Zen, mainly because it is just so
heavily modified from the original Firefox that I may end up building a whole new skin just for
compatibility unintentionally.

**Please do not try to port Natsumi to Zen.** I have my reasons why I left it, and I would
really appreciate it if you respected my decision.

### "When does Natsumi update?"
There is no fixed schedule for updates, it all happens randomly.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with non-Firefox-based browsers (Chrome, Arc, etc.)?"
No. Natsumi is made on top of Firefox, so it only supports Firefox and (most of) its forks.

If you try to apply Natsumi on Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply
userchrome CSS files, making Natsumi completely incompatible with those browsers.

### "I don't like the design, please change it!"
Although Natsumi is designed to be as customizable as possible, there may be some opinionated
design choices that I may not change. In the end, Natsumi is still my personal browser skin.

If you would like me to add options for certain aspects of the browser, please open a feature request
and I will consider it.

### "Can I use your code for my browser?"
If your browser is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3 or later (or AGPLv3 or later), then yes.
Otherwise, please contact me so I can grant you permission.

### "Why is userChrome.css so empty?"
Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin,
instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable
and disable custom CSS.

### "mrrp"
meow :3

## Troubleshooting
### "URLbar blur won't work!"
Make sure both `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.force-enabled` are
set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering.

### "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!"
These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on
the right to create the config.

You can also access most of the configs through the browser preferences page if Natsumi Append is
installed.

### "I don't see the Customize Natsumi option in the settings page!"
Please check that you've installed fx-autoconfig and `userChromeJS.persistent_domcontent_callback` is
true.

### "Natsumi looks very weird in Floorp/Waterfox!"
This may be because you do not have the Proton design (i.e. the default Firefox design) enabled. Natsumi
only supports Proton and does not support other designs such as Lepton or Fluerial.

You can fix this by going to Floorp Hub => Tab & Appearance in Floorp or Look & Feel in Waterfox.

### "I can't use custom skin X with Natsumi, please add support for it!"
This is not something I am able to help with. Natsumi is not tested with other themes in mind, so it is
possible that installing incompatible themes alongside Natsumi may break one or more of them.

### "Why is my browser showing as not compatible with Natsumi?"
> [!NOTE]
> This is for users seeing the compatibility warning after installing Natsumi. If you're wondering why
> the browser shows up as not compatible on the compatibility table, you may want to refer to the notes
> for each incompatible browser.

If you see this warning, it means Natsumi intentionally isn't supported on your browser due to serious
concerns or severe compatibility issues.

When a browser's developers have stances that go against Natsumi's core values (especially regarding
user customization) or a browser is heavily modified from Firefox to the point that it basically doesn't
use Firefox's selectors, this can sometimes lead to me having to push out patches often just to address
feature restrictions, compatibility issues and so on. This is not sustainable for me as Natsumi's
developer, so I intentionally do not support such browsers out of caution.

Please consider using another compatible browser or uninstall Natsumi.

### "Something's bugged!"
There may be userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things. Please disable
these then try again.

If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.
